Most developers now know to check the initial URL to ensure it doesn't point to a private IP.</p>\n<p>But there is a more subtle, \"ghostly\" version of this attack that relies on the way HTTP clients handle redirects. It\u2019s a fascinating look at how trust can be exploited across different layers of the network stack, and it shows why a simple IP check on the initial URL is rarely enough.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-22T10:21:35+00:00", "date_published": "2026-02-21T10:49:50+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://avinesh.dev/projects/", "url": "https://avinesh.dev/projects/", "title": "Projects", "content_html": "<p>Check out some of the things I've built and contributed to.</p>\n<div class=\"card-grid\">\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller\" ...", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-22T10:02:28+00:00", "date_published": "2026-02-21T10:49:50+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://avinesh.dev/", "url": "https://avinesh.dev/", "title": "Home", "content_html": "<div class=\"tx-hero\">\n  <h1>Building Systems.<br>Solving Problems.</h1>\n  <div class=\"tx-hero-text\">\n  <p>\n    I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> and ...", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-22T09:26:38+00:00", "date_published": "2026-02-21T10:49:50+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://avinesh.dev/about/", "url": "https://avinesh.dev/about/", "title": "About", "content_html": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n  <h1 style=\"border-bottom: none; margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 2.5rem;\">Avinesh Tripathi</h1>\n  <div styl...", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-21T16:57:23+00:00", "date_published": "2026-02-21T10:49:50+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://avinesh.dev/blog/", "url": "https://avinesh.dev/blog/", "title": "Blogs", "content_html": "<h1>Blogs</h1>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-21T16:57:23+00:00", "date_published": "2026-02-21T10:49:50+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://avinesh.dev/404/", "url": "https://avinesh.dev/404/", "title": "404", "content_html": "<div class=\"tx-404\">\n  <h1>404</h1>\n  <p>Looks like this page took a wrong redirect. \ud83d\udc7b</p>\n  <p>Maybe our <a href=\"/\">homepage</a> or <a href=\"/blog/\">blog</...", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-21T10:49:50+00:00", "date_published": "2026-02-21T10:49:50+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://avinesh.dev/blog/2026/02/12/adding-metrics--tls-to-a-kubernetes-controller---the-kustomize-way/", "url": "https://avinesh.dev/blog/2026/02/12/adding-metrics--tls-to-a-kubernetes-controller---the-kustomize-way/", "title": "Adding Metrics &amp; TLS to a Kubernetes Controller - The Kustomize Way", "content_html": "<h1>Adding Metrics &amp; TLS to a Kubernetes Controller - The Kustomize Way</h1>\n<p>I recently worked on adding metrics and TLS support to the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller\">Node Readiness Controller</a>, a kubernetes-sigs project I contribute to.
