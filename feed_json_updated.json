Most developers now know to check the initial URL to ensure it doesn't point to a private IP.</p>\n<p>But there is a more subtle, \"ghostly\" version of this attack that relies on the way HTTP clients handle redirects. It\u2019s a fascinating look at how trust can be exploited across different layers of the network stack, and it shows why a simple IP check on the initial URL is rarely enough.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-21T10:49:50+00:00", "date_published": "2026-02-21T10:49:50+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://avinesh.dev/blog/2026/02/12/adding-metrics--tls-to-a-kubernetes-controller---the-kustomize-way/", "url": "https://avinesh.dev/blog/2026/02/12/adding-metrics--tls-to-a-kubernetes-controller---the-kustomize-way/", "title": "Adding Metrics &amp; TLS to a Kubernetes Controller - The Kustomize Way", "content_html": "<h1>Adding Metrics &amp; TLS to a Kubernetes Controller - The Kustomize Way</h1>\n<p>I recently worked on adding metrics and TLS support to the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller\">Node Readiness Controller</a>, a kubernetes-sigs project I contribute to.
